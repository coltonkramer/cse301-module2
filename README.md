# Overview
This is my first unity project. I decided to make a simple side scroller game with a start and an end point. It is pretty simple you can jump from block to block but if you fall you start back at the beginning

#Purpose
The purpose of writing this software is to better fimiliarize myself with Unity and become a more well rounded developer

# Future Work

* Create an end screen - for some reason it wasnt allowing me to switch to an end screen so because of time constraints I abandoned the idea
* To make it hard eliminate the ability to alter velocity in mid-air
* Create more levels and variety to obsticles
